## 🔐 How It Works

### Navigation Filtering
```typescript
// Dashboard automatically filters menu items based on:
1. User Role (owner, admin, manager, etc.)
2. Subscription Plan (starter, standard, growth, enterprise)

// Both must allow access for page to appear
```

### When Limits Are Enforced

#### Branch Limits (Settings Page):
- ✅ Shows: "Your starter plan allows 1 branch. You currently have 1."
- 🔴 Button disabled when limit reached
- 📢 Alert shows upgrade prompt

#### Warehouse Limits (Warehouses Page):
- ✅ Shows: "Your standard plan allows 1 warehouse. You currently have 0."
- 🔴 Button disabled when limit reached
- 📢 Alert shows upgrade prompt

#### Page Access (Navigation):
- ❌ Starter users don't see Warehouse/Supplier pages AT ALL
- ✅ Standard+ users see them normally

## 📞 Quick Answers

**Q: Why can't I see the Warehouse page?**  
A: Warehouse management requires Standard plan or higher. Starter plan is for single-location businesses without warehouse needs.

**Q: I had unlimited branches on Growth plan, why is it now 4?**  
A: We've restructured plans to offer better value at each tier. Enterprise plan now offers unlimited branches for businesses that need to scale beyond 4 locations.

**Q: Can I still access my existing warehouses if I downgrade?**  
A: Yes, you can view existing warehouses, but you cannot create new ones beyond your plan's limit.

**Q: How do I upgrade my plan?**  
A: Go to Settings → Subscription or click any "Upgrade Plan" link in the app. You can upgrade anytime.

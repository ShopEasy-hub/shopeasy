## ✅ FIXED ISSUES

- ✅ **Atomic Operations**: Stock updates are now properly synchronized
- ✅ **No More Duplicates**: Automatic deduplication in the frontend
- ✅ **Persistent Data**: Stock quantities persist correctly across page refreshes
- ✅ **Proper Deletion**: Delete operations now work correctly

**How to use:**
1. Go to **Inventory** page
2. Click **"Add Product"** to create a new product
3. Enter "Initial Stock" to set stock for the current branch
4. Use **"Stock"** button to adjust quantities (uses add/subtract operations)

### 2. POS & INVENTORY NOW PROPERLY LINKED

**What was wrong:**
- POS could complete sales even with zero stock
- Stock didn't decrease after sales
- No validation before transactions

**What's fixed:**
- ✅ **Stock Validation**: POS checks available stock before adding to cart
- ✅ **Automatic Deduction**: Stock decreases immediately when sale is completed
- ✅ **Smart Warnings**: System warns when stock is low but allows override with confirmation
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Stock levels update instantly after each sale

**How it works:**
1. **Adding to Cart:**
   - System checks available stock in current branch
   - If stock = 0: Shows warning, requires confirmation to proceed
   - If quantity > stock: Prevents adding to cart

2. **Completing Sale:**
   - Final stock validation before processing
   - Stock is atomically decremented in database
   - Local state updates immediately for instant UI feedback
   - If sale fails, stock is not deducted

3. **Stock Display:**
   - POS shows current stock on each product card
   - Cart shows remaining stock after items added
   - Color-coded warnings (green=good, yellow=low, red=critical)

**Stock Status Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Green**: Healthy stock levels
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Low stock (≤5 units)
- 🔴 **Red**: Critical/Out of stock (0 units)

# 🔧 FIX: "Failed to process sale" Error

## What You're Seeing
```
❌ Failed to process sale. Please try again.
```

## Root Cause
The database function `upsert_inventory_safe()` is missing. This happens when the SQL migration didn't run successfully.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION - 2 Steps

### Step 1: Run Debug Check (1 min)
This will tell us exactly what's wrong.

```
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy /DEBUG_CHECK.sql
3. Paste and Run
4. Read the output
```

**Look for this message:**
- ✅ "Function EXISTS" = Good! Go to Step 2
- ❌ "Function MISSING" = Need to run migration

---

### Step 2: Run the Migration (3 min)

```
1. Open file: /supabase/migrations/COMPLETE_FIX_V3_CORRECTED.sql
2. Copy ENTIRE file (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. Paste in Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"
5. Wait for "✅✅✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED! ✅✅✅"
```

---

## After Running Migration

### 1. Hard Refresh Browser
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
(or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac)
```

### 2. Open Browser Console
```
Press: F12
Go to "Console" tab
```

### 3. Try POS Sale Again
- Add product to cart
- Click "Complete Sale"
- Select payment method
- Click "Confirm"

### 4. Check Console Output

**Good Logs (Success):**
```
✅ Sale completed successfully
📄 Receipt data prepared
🔄 Reloading stock levels after sale...
```

**Bad Logs (Still Failing):**
```
❌ Error processing sale: 
❌ function upsert_inventory_safe does not exist
```

## If Still Failing After Migration

### Copy EXACT Error From Console

Press F12, go to Console tab, find the red error, then copy:

1. **Error Message**: The exact text
2. **Error Code**: (if any, like `42883`)
3. **Stack Trace**: The technical details

Then paste it and tell me.

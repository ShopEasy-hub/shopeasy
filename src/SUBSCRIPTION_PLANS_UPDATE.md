## 🛡️ Plan-Based Access Control

### 1. Branch Limits
The system validates branch creation against plan limits:

```typescript
export const BRANCH_LIMITS: Record<SubscriptionPlan, number> = {
  starter: 1,
  standard: 2,
  growth: 4,
  enterprise: 999, // Unlimited
};
```

**User Experience:**
- **In Settings → Branches:**
  - Shows current branch count vs. limit
  - "Add Branch" button disabled when limit reached
  - Shows upgrade prompt when limit exceeded
- **Validation Messages:**
  - "Your starter plan allows 1 branch. You currently have 1."
  - "Branch limit reached! Please upgrade your plan to add more branches."

---

### 2. Warehouse Limits
The system validates warehouse creation and access:

```typescript
export const WAREHOUSE_LIMITS: Record<SubscriptionPlan, number> = {
  starter: 0,      // No warehouse access
  standard: 1,
  growth: 2,
  enterprise: 999, // Unlimited
};
```

**User Experience:**
- **Starter Plan:**
  - ❌ Warehouse, Suppliers, and Supply Chain pages are **completely hidden** from navigation
  - Cannot access warehouse features at all
- **Standard, Growth, Enterprise:**
  - ✅ Can access warehouse features
  - Shows current warehouse count vs. limit
  - "Add Warehouse" button disabled when limit reached
  - Upgrade prompt displayed when limit exceeded

**Validation Messages:**
- **Starter:** "Warehouse access is not available on the starter plan. Upgrade to Standard or higher to access warehouses."
- **Standard:** "Your standard plan allows 1 warehouse. You currently have 0."
- **Growth:** "Your growth plan allows 2 warehouses. You currently have 1."

---

### 3. Navigation Filtering

The dashboard now uses **dual-layer permission checking**:

```typescript
// Check both role AND plan permissions
function canAccessPageFull(
  userRole: string | null, 
  pageId: string, 
  subscriptionPlan: string | null
): boolean {
  // First check role-based access
  const hasRoleAccess = canAccessPage(userRole, pageId);
  if (!hasRoleAccess) return false;
  
  // Then check plan-based access
  const hasPlanAccess = canAccessPageByPlan(subscriptionPlan, pageId);
  return hasPlanAccess;
}
```

**Plan-Restricted Pages:**
- `warehouses` - Hidden on Starter
- `suppliers` - Hidden on Starter  
- `supply-chain` - Hidden on Starter

---

### 4. Upgrade Path
- One-click upgrade button in Settings and Warehouse pages
- Links directly to subscription plans page
- Clear messaging about what features unlock with each tier

## 📏 Limit Enforcement Rules

### 1. Keep Oldest Entities (Fair Approach)
When downgrading, the system keeps the **oldest** entities active:
- ✅ Fair to the user (they created them first)
- ✅ Likely to be their most important entities
- ✅ Predictable and transparent

**Example:**
- Branch A created Jan 1 → **ACTIVE** ✅
- Branch B created Jan 15 → Over-limit (view-only)
- Branch C created Jan 30 → Over-limit (view-only)

### 2. Owner Always Active
The account owner **NEVER** gets deactivated:
- ✅ Owner always counts as one of the allowed users
- ✅ Additional users fill remaining slots
- ✅ Owner can always login and manage

### 3. View-Only Access
Over-limit entities are **NOT deleted**, just restricted:
- 👁️ Can view all data
- 📊 Can see reports and history
- ❌ Cannot edit or modify
- ❌ Cannot create new records
- 💾 All historical data intact

### 4. Automatic Reactivation
When user upgrades, entities auto-reactivate:
- User on Starter (1 branch, 5 total branches)
- Upgrades to Growth (4 branches allowed)
- **Automatic:** 3 more branches become active
- **Instant:** No manual reactivation needed

---

## 🎯 Post-Trial Subscription Confirmation

### ✅ CONFIRMED: After Trial Expiry

**The plan they subscribe to determines their access:**

1. **Trial expires** → All access blocked (if no subscription)
2. **Subscribe to Starter** → Get Starter limits only
3. **Subscribe to Standard** → Get Standard limits only
4. **Subscribe to Growth** → Get Growth limits only
5. **Subscribe to Enterprise** → Get Enterprise (unlimited) access

**NO exceptions.** The active paid plan determines what features and limits apply.

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Starter Limits (Most Restrictive)
```sql
-- Create org on trial
-- Add: 5 branches, 3 warehouses, 10 users, 1000 products

-- Downgrade to Starter
UPDATE organizations 
SET subscription_plan = 'starter', subscription_status = 'active'
WHERE id = 'test-org-id';

-- Expected Results:
-- ✅ 1 branch active, 4 over-limit
-- ✅ 0 warehouses active, 3 over-limit
-- ✅ 2 users active, 8 over-limit
-- ✅ 500 products accessible, 500 over-limit
```

### Test 2: Standard Upgrade Path
```sql
-- Start with Starter (over-limit state)
-- Upgrade to Standard
UPDATE organizations 
SET subscription_plan = 'standard', subscription_status = 'active'
WHERE id = 'test-org-id';

-- Expected Results:
-- ✅ 2 branches active (was 1)
-- ✅ 1 warehouse active (was 0)
-- ✅ 5 users active (was 2)
-- ✅ 2000 products accessible (was 500)
```

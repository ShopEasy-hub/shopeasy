## ✅ Quick Fix (5 Minutes Total)

### Step 1️⃣: Fix Production URL (1 minute)

**Open this file:**
```
/lib/config.ts
```

**Line 25 - Change this:**
```typescript
const PRODUCTION_URL = 'https://your-production-domain.com';
```

**To your actual deployed URL:**
```typescript
// Example if deployed on Vercel:
const PRODUCTION_URL = 'https://shopeasy-pos.vercel.app';

// Example if you have custom domain:
const PRODUCTION_URL = 'https://pos.yourbusiness.com';

// Example if deployed on Netlify:
const PRODUCTION_URL = 'https://shopeasy-pos.netlify.app';
```

💡 **Don't have a production URL yet?** Skip this for now, but come back before deploying!

## 📊 Before & After

### BEFORE ❌

**Email:**
```
From: Supabase Auth <noreply@supabase.io>
Subject: Reset Your Password
[Plain generic email]
```

**Link:**
```
http://localhost:3000?reset-password=true
(Even in production! ❌)
```

### AFTER ✅

**Email:**
```
From: ShopEasy Support <noreply@shopeasy.com>
Subject: Reset Your ShopEasy Password

┌─────────────────────┐
│   🏪 ShopEasy POS   │
│  (Green branded)    │
│  Professional HTML  │
│  [Reset Password]   │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Link:**
```
Development: http://localhost:5173?reset-password=true ✅
Production: https://your-domain.com?reset-password=true ✅
(Automatically uses correct URL!)
```

## 🎯 How It Works

The system now **automatically detects** your environment:

| Environment | Reset Link Uses | Is This Right? |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Development** (localhost) | `http://localhost:5173` | ✅ Yes |
| **Production** (deployed) | Your `PRODUCTION_URL` | ✅ Yes |

You don't need to do anything - it just works! 🎉

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Link still opens localhost in production"

**Causes:**
- Didn't update `/lib/config.ts`
- Didn't deploy changes
- Testing from localhost (not production)

**Fixes:**
1. Check line 25 in `/lib/config.ts`
2. Save and deploy
3. Test from deployed site, not localhost

---

### "Email still shows Supabase"

**Causes:**
- Template not saved in Supabase
- Wrong template selected

**Fixes:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Authentication → Email Templates → Reset Password
3. Verify custom HTML is there
4. Click Save again
5. Request new reset email

---

### "Email not received"

**Check:**
- ✅ Spam/junk folder
- ✅ Wait 2-3 minutes
- ✅ Email address correct
- ✅ Supabase logs: Dashboard → Logs

---

### "Invalid or expired link"

**Causes:**
- Link expires after 1 hour
- Link can only be used once
- Already logged in

**Fixes:**
- Request new reset
- Logout first
- Use link within 1 hour

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test Locally First
You can test the entire flow in development (localhost) before deploying. The link will use localhost - **this is correct!**

### Tip 2: Custom Email Domain
For max professionalism, set up custom SMTP:
- Emails from: `noreply@yourdomain.com`
- Instead of: Supabase email
- See `/EMAIL_CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md` section 2.5

### Tip 3: Watch Console
When you load your app, check browser console for:
```
🔧 App Configuration: { ... }
```
This shows which URL will be used.

If production URL not configured, you'll see:
```
⚠️ WARNING: Production URL not configured!
```

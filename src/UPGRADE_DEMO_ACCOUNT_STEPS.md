## 🎯 Quick Steps

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Login to your project
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

---

### Step 2: Find Your Organization ID

Copy and paste this query into the SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT 
  o.id as org_id,
  o.name as org_name,
  o.subscription_plan as current_plan,
  o.subscription_status as current_status,
  up.email as owner_email,
  up.name as owner_name
FROM organizations o
JOIN user_profiles up ON up.id = o.owner_id
WHERE up.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';
```

**Replace `YOUR_EMAIL_HERE`** with the email you used to sign up.

Example:
```sql
WHERE up.email = 'demo@shopeasy.com';
```

**Click "Run" (or press F5)**

You should see output like:
```
org_id: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
org_name: Demo Company
current_plan: starter
current_status: trial
owner_email: demo@shopeasy.com
owner_name: John Doe
```

### Step 3: Upgrade to Enterprise

Copy and paste this query into the SQL Editor:

```sql
UPDATE organizations o
SET 
  subscription_plan = 'enterprise',
  subscription_status = 'active',
  subscription_end_date = NOW() + INTERVAL '1 year',
  trial_start_date = NULL,
  updated_at = NOW()
FROM user_profiles up
WHERE o.owner_id = up.id
  AND up.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';
```

**Replace `YOUR_EMAIL_HERE`** with your email (same as Step 2).

**Click "Run"**

You should see:
```
Success. No rows returned
```

This means it worked!

---

### Step 4: Verify the Upgrade

Run this query to confirm:

```sql
SELECT 
  o.name as organization,
  o.subscription_plan as plan,
  o.subscription_status as status,
  o.subscription_end_date as expires_on,
  up.email as owner_email
FROM organizations o
JOIN user_profiles up ON up.id = o.owner_id
WHERE up.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';
```

**Expected Output:**
```
organization: Demo Company
plan: enterprise ✅
status: active ✅
expires_on: 2025-12-04 (1 year from now) ✅

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Query returned no rows"

**Problem:** Email doesn't match any organization.

**Fix:** 
1. Check the email is correct
2. Run Step 2 query first to find your account
3. Try searching by organization name:
```sql
SELECT o.*, up.email
FROM organizations o
JOIN user_profiles up ON up.id = o.owner_id
WHERE o.name ILIKE '%Demo%';
```

---

### "Still seeing 'trial' status"

**Problem:** Browser cached old data.

**Fix:**
1. Logout completely
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Close all browser tabs
4. Open new tab and login again

---

### "Warehouses still blocked"

**Problem:** Status might be 'expired' instead of 'active'.

**Fix:** Run this:
```sql
UPDATE organizations
SET subscription_status = 'active'
WHERE id = 'YOUR_ORG_ID_FROM_STEP_2';
```

---

### "Want to extend expiry date"

**To give 5 years instead of 1:**
```sql
UPDATE organizations o
SET subscription_end_date = NOW() + INTERVAL '5 years'
FROM user_profiles up
WHERE o.owner_id = up.id
  AND up.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';
```

**To make it never expire (999 years):**
```sql
UPDATE organizations o
SET subscription_end_date = NOW() + INTERVAL '999 years'
FROM user_profiles up
WHERE o.owner_id = up.id
  AND up.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';
```

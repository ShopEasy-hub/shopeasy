## 🔧 What Gets Fixed

### Before Fix:
```
Database:
  auth.users: 5 records
  user_profiles: 8 records (3 orphaned!)
  ❌ Out of sync

App Shows:
  8 users (including 3 ghosts that can't login)
```

### After Fix:
```
Database:
  auth.users: 5 records
  user_profiles: 5 records
  ✅ In sync

App Shows:
  5 users (all can login)
```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION

After running both scripts:

### 1. Check Database (SQL)

```sql
-- Both should be equal:
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users) as auth,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_profiles) as profiles;
```

### 2. Check App

- Go to Users page
- Count should match database
- Each user should have role badge
- No errors in console (F12)

### 3. Test Add User

- Click "Add User"
- Fill form
- Submit
- User appears immediately ✅

### 4. Test Login

- Logout
- Login with new user
- Should work ✅

---

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Open Browser Console

Press F12, go to Console tab, look for:

```javascript
// Should see:
✅ Transformed users: [{...}, {...}]
📊 Users count: 5

// If you see errors:
❌ Error loading users: <message>
```

### Check These:

1. **RLS Policy:**
   ```sql
   -- Should show at least one SELECT policy:
   SELECT policyname, cmd 
   FROM pg_policies 
   WHERE tablename = 'user_profiles';
   ```

2. **Organization ID:**
   ```javascript
   // In console:
   console.log(appState.orgId);
   // Should show a valid UUID
   ```

3. **Data exists:**
   ```sql
   -- Should return users:
   SELECT * FROM user_profiles 
   WHERE organization_id = '<your-org-id>';
   ```

---

## 🔄 Nuclear Option (Last Resort)

If nothing works:

### 1. Backup Users

```sql
SELECT email, name, role, assigned_branch_id
FROM user_profiles
WHERE role != 'owner';
```

**COPY THIS!**

### 2. Delete All Non-Owners

```sql
DELETE FROM auth.users
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM user_profiles WHERE role != 'owner'
);
```

### 3. Verify Only Owner Remains

```sql
SELECT email, role FROM user_profiles;
-- Should only show owner
```

### 4. Recreate Users via App

- Login as owner
- Go to Users page
- Click "Add User" for each
- Use backed up data
- Test each login

# 📱 Barcode Scanner Guide - IMPORTANT

## 🚨 Why Your Scanner Isn't Working

Your scanner is working perfectly! The issue is that **"001" and "0002" are NOT barcodes** - they're just text/numbers.

### What You Have:
```
Product ID: 001
Product ID: 0002
```
These are just numbers typed into your product records.

### What You Need:
```
Actual Barcode Images:
[|||||| ||| || |||||||]  ← Black and white lines
```
The camera scanner looks for these visual patterns.

## 📊 Understanding Barcodes

### Barcode Types Supported by the Camera:
1. **UPC** (Universal Product Code) - 12 digits
   - Example: 012345678905
   - Common on retail products

2. **EAN** (European Article Number) - 13 digits
   - Example: 5901234123457
   - Common on European products

3. **Code128** - Alphanumeric
   - Example: ABC-12345
   - Flexible format

4. **Code39** - Alphanumeric
   - Example: *CODE39*
   - Simple format

5. **QR Codes** - 2D barcodes
   - Can contain any text/data

## ✅ Solutions for You

### Option 1: Use Manual Entry (EASIEST - Already Added!)
Your scanner now has a **"Enter Barcode Manually"** button:
1. Click the scan button
2. Click "Enter Barcode Manually"
3. Type "001" or "0002"
4. Click Submit

This works with your current product IDs!

### Option 2: Generate Real Barcodes
If you want to use the camera scanner, you need to generate actual barcode images:

**Free Online Barcode Generators:**
- https://www.barcodesinc.com/generator/
- https://www.barcode-generator.org/
- https://barcode.tec-it.com/en

**Steps:**
1. Go to a barcode generator website
2. Enter your product ID (001, 0002, etc.)
3. Choose format (Code128 recommended)
4. Download the barcode image
5. Print it and stick on your products
6. Now the camera can scan them!

### Option 3: Use Product Names/Search
Instead of scanning:
1. Click the search icon in POS
2. Type the product name
3. Add to cart
